# Production build

Now you want to bring your app online. It should be fast and optimized.
You want the full packageâ€”the PWA package.

In the development mode, you have the non-optimized code,
source maps and all the good things you need to write good code.

But in production you don't want to have unnecessary code; it should
be as small as possible.

## Optimize your build

In order to optimize your app for production, run the command `npm run build`.

This will optimize your app as follows:

- It runs the webpack [production mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/)
- It adds a [service worker](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/serviceworker-webpack-plugin) to your application to make it a PWA
- It compresses all assets

## Analyze your bundles

Sometimes your bundles are just too big and you have no idea why.

A tool to find out which parts of your bundles are too big is the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) plugin for webpack.

To use this tool and get an overview of your bundles, run `npm run analyze-bundle`.

This will display the following overview:
